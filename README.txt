for the use of the tune in the VCF Midwest '22 expo on the Commander X16
and all rights are otherwise reserved by the contributor.

You may also include a .inf file with up to 3 lines of plain txt (standard
alphanumeric characters only) having no more than 70 charactrs per line
which may be displayed as your tune plays during the demo.
